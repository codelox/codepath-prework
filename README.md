## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app.

1. After adding the Undo Button, it was not responding when clicked. This happened because the button was not properly connected to the @IBAction function in ViewController.swift.
2. When implementing the Undo feature, the app initially didnâ€™t restore the correct previous color. 

Overall I really enjoyed building Colorshift because it was simple, fun, and a great way to explore UI animations in iOS
